				<p>From the age of 10 I wanted a cat and two years later I got Mister. Basically, one day he came with his brother whose name is Grey and they were really scared. We tried a lot of times to pet them but they were so afrad and they didn't come closer. After a lot of time that i spent to make them feel safe and comfortable with me, they are a part of our family. Now Mister is 3 years old and Grey is 2 years old.</p>

						<p> In the morning they are crumpy and mad because they wake up before me and they don't eat until i wake up. Then we go together for a walk and we play with their toys. For lunch they usually eat fish or some meat and then they go to sleep again. Also while they are eating , they are watching their serie.In the evening they take a bath and after their meal they are going to bed. </p>
